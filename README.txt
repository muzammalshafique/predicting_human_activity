Title: Human Activity Prediction using Multi-Class Classification
Description: This project involves training a machine learning model to predict human activities using a dataset containing 20 input features and 1 output feature (concentration) with 8 activity categories. The dataset will be preprocessed, and various algorithms like Decision Trees, Random Forests, SVM, or KNeighborsClassifier etc. will be explored for classification. The best model will be selected, optimized, and evaluated using appropriate metrics. The final trained model will be used to predict human activities at certain time intervals or on new data, with potential applications in health monitoring and activity recognition.
